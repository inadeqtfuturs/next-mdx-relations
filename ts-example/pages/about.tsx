        next-mdx-relations is a small suite of utilities for statically
        generating pages for next.js from <code>md</code> and <code>mdx</code>.
        This site provides an example by adding a custom &apos;mentionedIn&apos;
        attribute to posts or pages that are mentioned in other posts or pages.
